#### Methodology
- Cross-Correlation

#### Examples
- Example 1: Histogram of Non-Normalized Lags (MP vs. BPM, VORP, NET RATING)
- Example 2: Plot Histogram of Normalized Lags (MP vs. BPM, VORP, NET RATING)
    - If two metrics moved in perfect synchrony, the distribution would be perfectly normal. If instead, one metric leads another the distribution will be skewed in either direction.
